Let's illustrate the differences between `git revert`, `git reset`, and `git restore` with examples, considering whether a new commit is created or a new commit ID is generated.

### Example Scenario:
Suppose you have a Git repository with the following commits in chronological order:

```
A --- B --- C --- D (master)
```

#### 1. git revert:

Let's say you want to revert commit `C` because it introduced a bug.

```bash
git revert C
```

Result:
```
A --- B --- C --- D --- E (master)
```

Explanation:
- `git revert` creates a new commit `E`, which undoes the changes introduced by commit `C`.
- A new commit `E` is created, and a new commit ID is generated.
- The project history is preserved, showing that commit `C` was reverted by commit `E`.

#### 2. git reset:

Let's say you want to reset the `master` branch back to commit `B`.

```bash
git reset --hard B
```

Result:
```
A --- B (master)
     \
      \--- C --- D
```

Explanation:
- `git reset --hard B` moves the `master` branch pointer back to commit `B`, discarding commits `C` and `D`.
- No new commits are created.
- The commit IDs of commits `C` and `D` are still present in the repository but are no longer part of the `master` branch's history.

#### 3. git restore:

Let's say you want to discard the changes made to a file `file.txt` since commit `B`.

```bash
git restore --source=B --staged file.txt
```

Result:
`file.txt` in the working directory is restored to its state at commit `B`, but no new commits are created.

Explanation:
- `git restore --source=B --staged file.txt` restores `file.txt` to its state at commit `B`, but it doesn't affect the project history.
- No new commits are created, and no new commit IDs are generated.
- The changes made to `file.txt` since commit `B` are effectively undone in the working directory and the staging area. However, this doesn't affect the commit history.

These examples demonstrate the differences between `git revert`, `git reset`, and `git restore` in terms of creating new commits and generating new commit IDs, as well as their effects on project history.





git reset and git restore are both commands that can be used to undo changes in a Git repository, but they work differently:

git reset: This command moves the current branch's HEAD pointer to a specified commit, effectively resetting the branch to that commit. The --hard option, as used in the example, not only moves the HEAD pointer but also resets the staging index and the working directory to match the state of the specified commit.

bash
Copy code
git reset --hard B
Effect:

css
Copy code
A --- B (master)
     \
      \--- C --- D
Commits C and D still exist in the repository, but the master branch no longer includes them. The HEAD pointer points to commit B, effectively "deleting" commits C and D from the current branch's history.
The working directory and staging area are also reset to match the state of commit B.
git restore: This command is used to restore files in the working directory to a specified state. It doesn't directly affect commits or the commit history.

bash
Copy code
git restore --source=B --staged file.txt
Effect:

The changes made to file.txt since commit B are discarded, and the file is restored to its state at commit B in both the working directory and the staging area. However, this action doesn't affect the commit history or the branch's HEAD pointer.
In summary:

git reset moves the branch's HEAD pointer to a specified commit, potentially "deleting" commits from the branch's history, and also resets the staging area and working directory.
git restore restores files in the working directory to a specified state without affecting the commit history.
