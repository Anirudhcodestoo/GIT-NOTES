## GIT
1. Other vcs are centralized one server but in  git each one has their own copy of the code in their own system (branched)server, Git has a distributed architecture.
2. repo acts as hub of directory , commits , programming files and staging
3.  But Git doesn't rely on any kind of centralized server to provide control organizations to its workflow. Git can work as a standalone program as a server and as a client. This means that you can use Git on a single machine without even having a network connection. Or you can use it as a server on a machine where you want to host your repository. And then you can use Git as a client to access the repository from another machine or even the same one. 
4. Git clients can communicate with Git servers over the network using HTTP, SSH or Git's own special protocol.
