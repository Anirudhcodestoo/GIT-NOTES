git revert
 makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit. Unlike the git reset command which rewrites your commit history, the git revert command creates a new commit which undoes the changes in a specific commit. Therefore, a revert command is generally safer than a reset command.

Additionally, there are some interesting considerations about how git object data is stored, such as the usage of SHA-1.

SHA-1 is what’s known as a hash function, a cryptographic function that generates a digital fingerprint of a file. Theoretically, it’s impossible for two different files to have the same SHA-1 hash, which means that SHA-1 can be used for two things:

Confirming that the contents of a file have not changed (digital signature).

Serving as an identifier for the file itself (a token or fingerprint).

Git calculates a hash for every commit. Those hashes are displayed by commands like git log or in various pages on Github. For commands like git revert, you can then use the hash to refer to a specific commit.
