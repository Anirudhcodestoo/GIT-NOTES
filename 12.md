#  FIRST STEPS WITH GIT 
1. When people talk about a Git repository, they usually mean the entire project along with its version control history.
2.  Awesome! The git directory acts as a database for all the changes tracked in Git and the working tree acts as a sandbox where we can edit the current versions of the files.
3. GIT STAGING AREA(INDEX)  A FILE MAINTAINED BY GIT --CONTAINS ALL INFO ABOUT WHAT CHANGES AND FILES ARE TO BE COMMITED IN MY NEXT COMMIT IT CONTAINES CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE SENT TO DIT DIRECTORY .... CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MARKED TO BE INCLUDED IN NEXT COMMIT
4. GIT WORKING TREE - CURRENT WORKING STATE OF PROJECT AND CURRENT CHANGES OF PREOJECT
5. COMMIT- SNAPPSHOT HOW PROJECT LOOOKED AT THAT TIME COMBINED MAKE HISTORY OF PEOJECT AND ITS INFO STORED IN GIT DIRECTORY
6. life cycle 

  ## 3 stages/states
   ### 1. If a file is in the modified state, it means that we've made changes to it that we haven't committed yet. The changes could be adding, modifying or deleting the contents of the file. Git notices anytime we modify our files. But won't store any changes until we add them to the staging area.
   ## 2. So, the next step is to stage those changes.
    ## 3. When we do this, our modified files become stage files. In other words, the changes to those files are ready to be committed to the project. All files that are staged will be part of the next snapshot we take. And finally, when a file gets committed, the changes made to it are safely stored in a snapshot in the Git directory.

7. # EACH GIT REPO HAS 
   ## - GIT DIRECTORY
   ## -STAGING AREA 
   ## -WORKING TREE
8.  # **without a commit message git commit  is aborted**
9.  ANATOMY OF COMMIT MESSAGE
  
A short description of the change (up to 50 characters), followed by a blank line, then one or more paragraphs giving more details of the change (if needed). Each line in the detailed paragraph(s) should be less than 72 characters.
