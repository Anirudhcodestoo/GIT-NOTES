2.  Red Lines: Red lines in the git log --graph output represent commits that are part of a different branch than the one you're currently viewing. These lines indicate the divergence and subsequent merging of branches. Each red line typically connects commits from different branches, showing the branching history of the repository.

3. Green Lines: Green lines, on the other hand, represent the mainline of commits on the current branch. These lines connect consecutive commits within the same branch, showing the linear progression of commits. Green lines indicate the chronological order of commits on the branch you're currently viewing.
